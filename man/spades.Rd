  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{A \code{simList} simulation object, generally produced by \code{simInit}.}

\item{debug}{Optional logical flag or character vector indicating what to print to
console at each event. See details.
Default is \code{debug=FALSE}.}

\item{progress}{Logical (TRUE or FALSE show a graphical progress bar),
character ("graphical", "text") or numeric indicating
the number of update intervals to show in a graphical progress bar.}

\item{cache}{Logical. If TRUE, then the spades call will be cached. This means that
if the call is made again with the same simList, then spades will return
the return value from the previous run of that exact same simList. Default
FALSE. See Details.}

\item{.plotInitialTime}{Numeric. Temporarily override the \code{.plotInitialTime}
parameter for all modules. See Details.}

\item{.saveInitialTime}{Numeric. Temporarily override the \code{.plotInitialTime}
parameter for all modules. See Details.}

\item{notOlderThan}{Date. Passed to SpaDES::cache to update the cache. Default is
NULL, meaning don't update the cache. If \code{Sys.time()} is provided
then, it will force a recache. Ignored if \code{cache} is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Any. Can be used to make a unique cache identity, such as "replicate = 1". This
will be included in the SpaDES::cache call, so will be unique and thus
spades will not use a cached copy as long
as anything passed in ... is unique, i.e., not cached previously.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the modified \code{simList} object.

\description{
Based on code from chapter 7.8.3 of Matloff (2011): "Discrete event simulation".
Here, we implement a simulation in a more modular fashion so it's easier to add
submodules to the simulation. We use S4 classes and methods, and use `data.table`
instead of `data.frame` to implement the event queue (because it is much faster).
}
\details{
The is the workhorse function in the SpaDES package. It runs simulations by
implementing the rules outlined in the \code{simList}.

This function gives simple access to two sets of module parameters:
\code{.plotInitialTime} and with \code{.plotInitialTime}. The primary use of
these arguments is to temporarily turn off plotting and saving. "Temporary"
means that the \code{simList} is not changed, so it can be used again with
the simList values reinstated. To turn off plotting and saving, use
\code{.plotInitialTime = NA} or \code{.saveInitialTime = NA}. NOTE: if a
module did not use \code{.plotInitialTime} or \code{.saveInitialTime}, then
these arguments will not do anything.

If \code{cache} is TRUE, this allows for a seamless way to "save" results
of a simulation. The  user does not have to intentionally do any saving manually.
Instead, upon a call to \code{spades} in which the simList is identical,
the function will simply return the result that would have come if it had
been rerun. Use this with caution, as it will return exactly the result from
a previous run, even if there is stochasticity internally. Caching is only
based on the input simList. See also \code{experiment} for the same mechanism,
but it can be used with replication.

If \code{debug} is specified, it can be Logical or character vector. In all
cases, something will be printed to the console immediately before each event is
being executed. If \code{TRUE}, then the event immediately following will be
printed as it runs (equivalent to current(sim)).
If a character string, then it can be one
of the many simList accessors, such as \code{events}, \code{params}, or
\code{"simList"} (print the entire simList), or any R expression.
If an R expression
if will be evaluated with access to the \code{sim}
object. If this is more than one character string, then all will be
printed to the screen in their sequence.
}
\note{
The debug option is primarily intended to facilitate building simulation
models by the user. Will print additional outputs informing the user of updates
to the values of various simList slot components.

 spades(mySim)

 # Different debug options
 spades(mySim, debug = TRUE) # Fastest
 spades(mySim, debug = "simList")
 spades(mySim, debug = "print(table(sim$landscape$Fires[]))")

 # Can turn off plotting, and inspect the output simList instead
 out <- spades(mySim, .plotInitialTime = NA) # much faster
 completed(out) # shows completed events

 # use cache -- simInit should generally be rerun each time a spades call is made
 #   to guarantee that it is identical. Here, run spades call twice, first
 #   time to establish cache, second time to return cached result
