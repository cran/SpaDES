### Develop and run spatially explicit discrete event simulation models

Easily implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on spatially explicit models. These include raster-based, event-based, and agent-based models.
The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules. 
Included are numerous tools to rapidly visualize raster and other maps.

## Installation

Building packages from source the appropriate development libraries for your operating system (*e.g.*, Windows users should install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)). In order to build the vignettes from source.

The suggested package `fastshp` can be installed with:

```r
install.packages("fastshp", repos="http://rforge.net", type="source")
```
